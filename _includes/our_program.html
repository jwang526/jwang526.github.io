		  benefit the most from music, including those who may not usually have the opportunity to enjoy music because of age or medical reasons, as well as children who get to be introduced to the amazing world
		  that music can be.
		  We work with local student musicians, encouraging them to use their incredible musical talent for a good cause- and we are ever grateful for their willingness and dedication.</h3>
