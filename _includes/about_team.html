         Jayden Wang began his music journey at the age of four, when he began learning piano. After moving to Granger, 
	 Indiana, in 2011, he has participated in and won many regional and state competitions. He has studied piano under Linda Belleville. 
	 Jayden also began playing cello when he was 11. He has since performed as principal cellist in the Penn High School Symphonic Orchestra, 
	 the South Bend Youth Symphony Orchestras, and participated in a piano trio in the Fischoff National Chamber Music Competition, 
	 winning the Geoffroy Award. He currently studies cello under Lara Turner.

		<h4>Cameron Poznanski</h4>

          <br>
             Cameron Poznanski, a senior at Penn High School, has aspired to be a great bassist since the sixth grade. He is the first in his family to fall in love with orchestral music 
	     and has taken huge steps in order to attain his aspirations. In his first year learning, with the help of his private teacher Gayle Sampson, he competed in the Level I ISSMA Solo Event,
	     earning a gold medal with a renowned piece named The Elephant. Every year since, he has earned gold medals in both the ISSMA solo and ensemble events. 
	     It was Cam's second year of learning the double bass that he auditioned for the South Bend Youth Symphony, earning himself a spot in the highest orchestra, 
	     allowing him to get 1 on 1 help with Ed Randles, a bassist for the South Bend Symphony, every Sunday. Recently, Cam's talent was noticed when he was offered a spot to play with the Notre Dame Orchestra
	     in their final concert Carmina Burana, and this summer, Cam has taken on the responsibility of teaching a middle school student to play the bass
	     and hopefully inspire him to fall in love with the instrument like he did. Cam does not only have a passion for playing the bass, though, as he loves neuroscience, 
	     and he wishes to go to college to study it and find a career in the subject.
